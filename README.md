# 🌟 My Portfolio Website

Welcome, traveler of the web!  
Here lies the beating heart of my craft — a personal portfolio website, woven carefully with the threads of **HTML** and **CSS**. No heavy frameworks, no unnecessary clutter — just the honest weave of structure and style, as it has been done since the early days of the web.

## 📜 About This Project

This portfolio is a **showcase of my journey** — a growing testament to my skills, creativity, and evolving path in web development.  
It features:

- ✏️ Clean, semantic **HTML** for structure and soul
- 🎨 Elegant **CSS** for style, grace, and responsive beauty
- 🌿 A minimalist, timeless design philosophy: "Less, but better."
- 📱 Responsive layout — looks good on mobile, tablet, or the mighty desktop

The goal was simple yet bold:  
To **create something beautiful with just the basics**, proving that mastery of fundamentals can outshine the loudest of trends.



## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Ancient patience and modern dreams

## 📚 Lessons Learned

Through this project, I embraced the eternal truth:  
**Mastery begins with fundamentals.**  
In a world that chases shiny tools and fast fame, I chose to slow down, build from the roots, and honor the old ways of coding — clean, accessible, human-friendly websites.
